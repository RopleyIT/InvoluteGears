* Verify new curve-based SVG files work with Cut3D and machining tools

* Update gears other than involute to plot using DrawablePaths containing lists of coordinates

* Remove the old coordinate code from Involutes and Cutouts

* Use Bezier curves for undercuts in Involute gears

* Use Bezier curves and circular arcs for all gears

* Investigate circle wiggle

* Update console app to use new curves
